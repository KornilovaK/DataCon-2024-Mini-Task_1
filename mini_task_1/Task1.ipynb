In this study, the identification of a benzylpenicillin-specific aptamer was selected by rGO-SELEX (reduced Graphene Oxide-Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment). With these advantageous characteristics, we expect that this aptamer could be applied to an on-site detection system for residual benzylpenicillin.\\\"\",\n          \"Therapeutic: \\\" A population of improved Rev-binding aptamers can be used to inhibit viral\\nreplication, as opposed to a single RNA species.
