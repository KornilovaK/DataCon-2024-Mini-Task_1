 Nature ,Reactive Blue 4,"Photoreceptor that mediates primarily blue light inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and photoperiodic control of floral initiation, and regulates other light responses, including circadian rhythms, tropic growth, stomata opening, guard cell development, root development, bacterial and viral pathogen responses, abiotic stress responses, cell cycles, programmed cell death, apical dominance, fruit and ovule development, seed dormancy, and magnetoreception. Photoexcited cryptochromes interact with signaling partner proteins to alter gene expression at both transcriptional and post-translational levels and, consequently, regulate the corresponding metabolic and developmental programs. Blue-light absorbing flavoprotein that activates reversible flavin photoreduction via an electron transport chain comprising a tryptophan triad (W-324, W-377 and W-400), accompanied by a large conformational change upon photoexcitation, or via an alternative electron transport that involves small metabolites, including NADPH, NADH, and ATP. The half-life of the activated signaling state is about 5 minutes. Also involved in the detection of blue/green ratio in light (shade under leaf canopies) and subsequent adaptations on plant growth and development. In darkness, the dark reoxidation of flavin occurs and leads to inactivated state. Perceives low blue light (LBL) and responds by directly contacting two bHLH transcription factors, PIF4 and PIF5, at chromatin on E-box variant 5'-CA[CT]GTG-3' to promote their activity and stimulate specific gene expression to adapt global physiology (e.g. hypocotyl elongation and hyponastic growth in low blue light).",ssRNA,B4-25,5'GGGAGAAUUCCCGCGGCGUUGGCCCAGGAUAAUAGGACGAAAUCCGAAAAAUCCGUACCCAACAUAGAACCCCCCCAGCGCUCACACGGACGCCCCAUUACGGCUAACCGAACGCCUGCAGCCCGGGAAGCUU3',133,0.5939849624060151,kd<100µm,100000.0,5'-GGGAGAATTCCCGCGG-N97-CTGCAGCCCGGAAGCTT-3',97,"0.6 ml of 0.5 M LiCI, 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.6, 1 mM MgCl3",MgCl,Tris Buffers,7.6,"Detection: "" Isolate RNAs that bind to several dyes that appear to mimic metabolic cofactors.

 Nucleic Acids Res ,Rev protein of HIV-1 (minimal Rev-binding element (RBE) found within the Rev Responsive Element (RRE)),"Escorts unspliced or incompletely spliced viral pre-mRNAs (late transcripts) out of the nucleus of infected cells. These pre-mRNAs carry a recognition sequence called Rev responsive element (RRE) located in the env gene, that is not present in fully spliced viral mRNAs (early transcripts). This function is essential since most viral proteins are translated from unspliced or partially spliced pre-mRNAs which cannot exit the nucleus by the pathway used by fully processed cellular mRNAs. Rev itself is translated from a fully spliced mRNA that readily exits the nucleus. Rev's nuclear localization signal (NLS) binds directly to KPNB1/Importin beta-1 without previous binding to KPNA1/Importin alpha-1. KPNB1 binds to the GDP bound form of RAN (Ran-GDP) and targets Rev to the nucleus.

 Biochemistry ,Reverse Transcriptase of Type 1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1 RT),"Multifunctional enzyme that converts the viral RNA genome into dsDNA in the cytoplasm, shortly after virus entry into the cell. This enzyme displays a DNA polymerase activity that can copy either DNA or RNA templates, and a ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity that cleaves the RNA strand of RNA-DNA heteroduplexes in a partially processive 3' to 5' endonucleasic mode. Conversion of viral genomic RNA into dsDNA requires many steps. A tRNA3-Lys binds to the primer-binding site (PBS) situated at the 5'-end of the viral RNA. RT uses the 3' end of the tRNA primer to perform a short round of RNA-dependent minus-strand DNA synthesis. The reading proceeds through the U5 region and ends after the repeated (R) region which is present at both ends of viral RNA. The portion of the RNA-DNA heteroduplex is digested by the RNase H, resulting in a ssDNA product attached to the tRNA primer. This ssDNA/tRNA hybridizes with the identical R region situated at the 3' end of viral RNA. This template exchange, known as minus-strand DNA strong stop transfer, can be either intra- or intermolecular. RT uses the 3' end of this newly synthesized short ssDNA to perform the RNA-dependent minus-strand DNA synthesis of the whole template. RNase H digests the RNA template except for two polypurine tracts (PPTs) situated at the 5'-end and near the center of the genome. It is not clear if both polymerase and RNase H activities are simultaneous. RNase H probably can proceed both in a polymerase-dependent (RNA cut into small fragments by the same RT performing DNA synthesis) and a polymerase-independent mode (cleavage of remaining RNA fragments by free RTs). Secondly, RT performs DNA-directed plus-strand DNA synthesis using the PPTs that have not been removed by RNase H as primers. PPTs and tRNA primers are then removed by RNase H. The 3' and 5' ssDNA PBS regions hybridize to form a circular dsDNA intermediate.

 Biochemistry ,Human transcription factor NF-kB as a p50 homodimer (p502),"NF-kappa-B is a pleiotropic transcription factor present in almost all cell types and is the endpoint of a series of signal transduction events that are initiated by a vast array of stimuli related to many biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52 and the heterodimeric p65-p50 complex appears to be most abundant one. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. NF-kappa-B heterodimeric p65-p50 and RelB-p50 complexes are transcriptional activators. The NF-kappa-B p50-p50 homodimer is a transcriptional repressor, but can act as a transcriptional activator when associated with BCL3. NFKB1 appears to have dual functions such as cytoplasmic retention of attached NF-kappa-B proteins by p105 and generation of p50 by a cotranslational processing. The proteasome-mediated process ensures the production of both p50 and p105 and preserves their independent function, although processing of NFKB1/p105 also appears to occur post-translationally. p50 binds to the kappa-B consensus sequence 5'-GGRNNYYCC-3', located in the enhancer region of genes involved in immune response and acute phase reactions. In a complex with MAP3K8, NFKB1/p105 represses MAP3K8-induced MAPK signaling; active MAP3K8 is released by proteasome-dependent degradation of NFKB1/p105.",ssRNA,RNA aptamer 3,5'GGGAUAUCCUCGAGACAUAAGAAACAAGAUAGAUCCUGAAACUGUUUUAAGGUUGGCCGAUCUUCUGCUCGAGAAUGCAUGAAGCGUUCCAUAUUUUU3',98,0.40816326530612246,kd: 1.34 ± 0.2 nm,1.34,5‘-AAAAATATGGAACGCTTCATGCAT-N60-CTCGAGGATATCCCTATAGTG-3',60,"10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT",MgCl,Other Buffers,7.5,"Therapeutic  and Inhibition: ""We used in vitro selection to isolate a small RNA aptamer that binds with nanomolar affinity to human transcription factor NF-kappa B, a key regulator of inflammation, HIV-1 gene expression, and apoptosis.

 J Inorg Biochem ,Tat protein from HIV-1 in the presence of Zn2+ ion,"Transcriptional activator that increases RNA Pol II processivity, thereby increasing the level of full-length viral transcripts. Recognizes a hairpin structure at the 5'-LTR of the nascent viral mRNAs referred to as the transactivation responsive RNA element (TAR) and recruits the cyclin T1-CDK9 complex (P-TEFb complex) that will in turn hyperphosphorylate the RNA polymerase II to allow efficient elongation. The CDK9 component of P-TEFb and other Tat-activated kinases hyperphosphorylate the C-terminus of RNA Pol II that becomes stabilized and much more processive. Other factors such as HTATSF1/Tat-SF1, SUPT5H/SPT5, and HTATIP2 are also important for Tat's function. Besides its effect on RNA Pol II processivity, Tat induces chromatin remodeling of proviral genes by recruiting the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) CREBBP, EP300 and PCAF to the chromatin. This also contributes to the increase in proviral transcription rate, especially when the provirus integrates in transcriptionally silent region of the host genome. To ensure maximal activation of the LTR, Tat mediates nuclear translocation of NF-kappa-B by interacting with host RELA. Through its interaction with host TBP, Tat may also modulate transcription initiation. Tat can reactivate a latently infected cell by penetrating in it and transactivating its LTR promoter.

 Biochemistry ,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT),"Multifunctional enzyme that converts the viral RNA genome into dsDNA in the cytoplasm, shortly after virus entry into the cell. This enzyme displays a DNA polymerase activity that can copy either DNA or RNA templates, and a ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity that cleaves the RNA strand of RNA-DNA heteroduplexes in a partially processive 3' to 5' endonucleasic mode. Conversion of viral genomic RNA into dsDNA requires many steps. A tRNA3-Lys binds to the primer-binding site (PBS) situated at the 5'-end of the viral RNA. RT uses the 3' end of the tRNA primer to perform a short round of RNA-dependent minus-strand DNA synthesis. The reading proceeds through the U5 region and ends after the repeated (R) region which is present at both ends of viral RNA. The portion of the RNA-DNA heteroduplex is digested by the RNase H, resulting in a ssDNA product attached to the tRNA primer. This ssDNA/tRNA hybridizes with the identical R region situated at the 3' end of viral RNA. This template exchange, known as minus-strand DNA strong stop transfer, can be either intra- or intermolecular. RT uses the 3' end of this newly synthesized short ssDNA to perform the RNA-dependent minus-strand DNA synthesis of the whole template. RNase H digests the RNA template except for two polypurine tracts (PPTs) situated at the 5'-end and near the center of the genome. It is not clear if both polymerase and RNase H activities are simultaneous. RNase H probably can proceed both in a polymerase-dependent (RNA cut into small fragments by the same RT performing DNA synthesis) and a polymerase-independent mode (cleavage of remaining RNA fragments by free RTs). Secondly, RT performs DNA-directed plus-strand DNA synthesis using the PPTs that have not been removed by RNase H as primers. PPTs and tRNA primers are then removed by RNase H.

 Anal Chem ,Human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIVRT),"Multifunctional enzyme that converts the viral RNA genome into dsDNA in the cytoplasm, shortly after virus entry into the cell. This enzyme displays a DNA polymerase activity that can copy either DNA or RNA templates, and a ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity that cleaves the RNA strand of RNA-DNA heteroduplexes in a partially processive 3' to 5' endonucleasic mode. Conversion of viral genomic RNA into dsDNA requires many steps. A tRNA3-Lys binds to the primer-binding site (PBS) situated at the 5'-end of the viral RNA. RT uses the 3' end of the tRNA primer to perform a short round of RNA-dependent minus-strand DNA synthesis. The reading proceeds through the U5 region and ends after the repeated (R) region which is present at both ends of viral RNA. The portion of the RNA-DNA heteroduplex is digested by the RNase H, resulting in a ssDNA product attached to the tRNA primer. This ssDNA/tRNA hybridizes with the identical R region situated at the 3' end of viral RNA. This template exchange, known as minus-strand DNA strong stop transfer, can be either intra- or intermolecular. RT uses the 3' end of this newly synthesized short ssDNA to perform the RNA-dependent minus-strand DNA synthesis of the whole template. RNase H digests the RNA template except for two polypurine tracts (PPTs) situated at the 5'-end and near the center of the genome. It is not clear if both polymerase and RNase H activities are simultaneous. RNase H probably can proceed both in a polymerase-dependent (RNA cut into small fragments by the same RT performing DNA synthesis) and a polymerase-independent mode (cleavage of remaining RNA fragments by free RTs). Secondly, RT performs DNA-directed plus-strand DNA synthesis using the PPTs that have not been removed by RNase H as primers. PPTs and tRNA primers are then removed by RNase H. The 3' and 5' ssDNA PBS regions hybridize to form a circular dsDNA intermediate. Strand displacement synthesis by RT to the PBS and PPT ends produces a blunt ended, linear dsDNA copy of the viral genome that includes long terminal repeats (LTRs) at both ends.",ssDNA,Apt- 4.20,5‘AGCAGCACAGAGGTCAGATGACATGATGTTCGGACACGTGAAGGAATAGAAAGCCCTCACTTCAGCGTAGCACGCATAGG3‘,80,0.5125,kd: 180 ± 70 pm,0.18,5‘-AGCAGCACAGAGGTCAGATG-N40-TTCAGCGTAGCACGCATAGG-3‘,40,"10 mM tris, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5",MgCl,Tris Buffers,7.5,"Diagnostic: "" used CE-SELEX to obtain highaffinity ssDNA aptamers for HIVRT.

 Biochemistry ,RNase H domain of human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT),"Multifunctional enzyme that converts the viral RNA genome into dsDNA in the cytoplasm, shortly after virus entry into the cell. This enzyme displays a DNA polymerase activity that can copy either DNA or RNA templates, and a ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity that cleaves the RNA strand of RNA-DNA heteroduplexes in a partially processive 3' to 5' endonucleasic mode. Conversion of viral genomic RNA into dsDNA requires many steps. A tRNA3-Lys binds to the primer-binding site (PBS) situated at the 5'-end of the viral RNA. RT uses the 3' end of the tRNA primer to perform a short round of RNA-dependent minus-strand DNA synthesis. The reading proceeds through the U5 region and ends after the repeated (R) region which is present at both ends of viral RNA. The portion of the RNA-DNA heteroduplex is digested by the RNase H, resulting in a ssDNA product attached to the tRNA primer. This ssDNA/tRNA hybridizes with the identical R region situated at the 3' end of viral RNA. This template exchange, known as minus-strand DNA strong stop transfer, can be either intra- or intermolecular. RT uses the 3' end of this newly synthesized short ssDNA to perform the RNA-dependent minus-strand DNA synthesis of the whole template. RNase H digests the RNA template except for two polypurine tracts (PPTs) situated at the 5'-end and near the center of the genome. It is not clear if both polymerase and RNase H activities are simultaneous. RNase H probably can proceed both in a polymerase-dependent (RNA cut into small fragments by the same RT performing DNA synthesis) and a polymerase-independent mode (cleavage of remaining RNA fragments by free RTs). Secondly, RT performs DNA-directed plus-strand DNA synthesis using the PPTs that have not been removed by RNase H as primers. PPTs and tRNA primers are then removed by RNase H. The 3' and 5' ssDNA PBS regions hybridize to form a circular dsDNA intermediate. Strand displacement synthesis by RT to the PBS and PPT ends produces a blunt ended, linear dsDNA copy of the viral genome that includes long terminal repeats (LTRs) at both ends.",dsDNA,R12-2,5'ATGCTTCCACGAGCCTTTCGGGGTTGGTGTACGGTGGCAGGCTGCGAGGCGGTAGTCTATTC3',62,0.5967741935483871,kd: 70 nm,70.0,5'-ATGCTTCCACGAGCCTTTC-N22-CTGCGAGGCGGTAGTCTATTC-3',22,"50 mM Tris-HCl, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 25-400 mM KCl and 10 mM DTT",MgCl,Tris Buffers,7.5,"Therapeutic: "" Aptamer S-PS8.4, selected here for affinity for type IVB pili, has strong potential both as an antagonist against S. enterica serovar Typhi invasion of human monocytic cells and as a tool to analyze the interactions of bacterial type IVB pili with host cells and examine important aspects of bacterial pathogenesis.""",Not reported

RNA aptamers are promising tools with which to study the angiopoietins in vitro and in vivo. The use of 2′-modified nucleotides confers resistance to nuclease degradation, and 2′-fluoro-modified RNAs have plasma half-lives of greater than 12 h [37]. The in vivo circulating half-life of these aptamers can be improved further by the addition of PEG or cholesterol moieties to their 5′ ends [38]. The full-length ANG9-4 aptamer (96 nucleotides) can be transcribed in vitro in quantities sufficient for cell culture and some small animal models. However, chemical synthesis, with or without 5′ modification, is inefficient for RNAs greater than 60 nucleotides in length. Work is ongoing to truncate and modify the full-length aptamer for large-scale synthesis and application in animal models."

Consistent with aptamer-induced intracellular degradation of ErbB-2/HER2, incubation of gastric cancer cells with the trimeric aptamer promoted translocation of ErbB-2/HER2 from the cell surface to cytoplasmic puncta. This translocation was associated with a lysosomal hydrolase-dependent clearance of the ErbB-2/HER2 protein from cell extracts. We conclude that targeting ErbB-2/HER2 with DNA aptamers might retard the tumorigenic growth of gastric cancer by means of accelerating lysosomal degradation of the oncoprotein. This work exemplifies the potential pharmacological utility of aptamers directed at cell surface proteins, and it highlights an endocytosis-mediated mechanism of tumor inhibition.""","""As shown in Fig. 2A, strong binding of monomeric aptamer 2-2 was detected only at the higher amount (20 μg) but not at the 10-fold lower amount of spotted cell lysate. However, the trimeric version of the aptamer clearly displayed specific binding with extracts derived from N87 cells at both high and low amounts of cell lysates. The relatively low level of ErbB-2 expressed by A431 cells likely underlies the minor signal we observed with these cells. Flow cytometry analyses similarly supported enhanced binding by the trimeric aptamer. Biotin-labeled trimeric aptamers 2-2(t) and PR(t) were incubated with N87 cells, before treatment with phycoerythrin streptavidin and fluorescence-based cell analysis. As indicated by Fig. 2B, the trimeric aptamer 2-2(t) was able to efficiently bind with ErbB-2–overexpressing cells, whereas the controls demonstrated no binding.""
